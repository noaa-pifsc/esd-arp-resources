survey_type: Benthic cover estimates from photoquadrat imagery
survey_description: Photoquadrat imagery is collected at sites (1m above the benthos, every 1m along a 30m transect) and annotated using CoralNet.  Surveys are conducted at select sites following a stratified-random sampling site design (StRS). Random sites are generated along a depth gradient using the R project <a href = "https://github.com/krtanaka/ncrmp_common_map" target = "_blank">ncrmp_common_map</a>.  Images are analyzed to produce three functional group levels of benthic cover. Refer to InPort metadata records or SOP for more details.

how_to_download: Metadata is distinguished by region and site type (fixed or random). For random sites, due to the stratified random sampling designs (StRS), data should be analyzed only at island and region level.  Raw imagery is archived separately and is accessible under 'Related Items' for each region's benthic cover metadata record (see Access Rawdata below).
