survey_type: Collection of SfM Imagery
survey_description: SfM imagery is collected at both random and fixed sites. The images can then be processed into 3D coral models, with which various data can be extracted. Starting in 2024, coral demographic data was exclusively collected in this manner. Structural complexity, bleaching, urchin, and corallivory estimates have also been extracted from SfM models with funding by the CRCP as other projects.
