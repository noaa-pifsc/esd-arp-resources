survey_type: Measuring reef habitat growth and erosion
survey_description: NCRMP carbonate budget assessments were adapted for U.S. Pacific Islands reef species from the Chris Perry's Indo-Pacific
 <a href ="https://geography.exeter.ac.uk/reefbudget/">Reef Budget</a> approach.  Our NCRMP protocol was developed after several years of testing various methodologies to collect benthic, urchin, and fish data. Fish data is collected using SPC surveys. Urchin data is observed by divers along a transect (though depending on region can also be extracted from imagery). Benthic data is extracted from structure-from-motion (SfM) models.
