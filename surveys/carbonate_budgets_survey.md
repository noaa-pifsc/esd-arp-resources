survey_type: Measuring reef growth and shrinkage
survey_description: Carbonate Budgets was adapted for Pacific species from Chris Perry's <a href ="https://geography.exeter.ac.uk/reefbudget/">reefbudgetR</a> for Atlantic species. After several years of testing various methodologies to collect benthic, urchin, and fish data we have established a NCRMP protocol. Fish data is collected using SPC surveys as well as belt surveys (for parrotfish).  Urchin data is observed by divers along a transect (though depending on region can also be extracted from imagery). Benthic data is extracted from structure-from-motion (SfM) models.
