survey_type: Stationary-point-count (SPC) surveys
survey_description: Fish SPC surveys intend to provide a snapshot of the biodiversity and biomass at a given time as a rapid ecological assessment tool. Surveys are conducted at select sites following a stratified-random sampling site design (StRS). Random sites are generated along a depth gradient using the R project <a href = "https://github.com/krtanaka/ncrmp_common_map" target = "_blank">ncrmp_common_map</a>.

how_to_download: Due to the StRS survey design, multiple sites must be sampled to approximate the biodiveristy and biomass of a given sector to be analyzed on a regional scale.  Sectors are determined by species richness and/or density as well as geography such as northeast, southwest, etc. Therefore Fish SPC data should only be analyzed at a regional scale.
