survey_description:  SOP, data processing and R code can be accessed in this <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.176" target ="_blank">2017 publication</a> and other aspects of rapid ecological assessment (REA) survey methods are also described in this <a href = "https://doi.org/10.7289/v5sn06zt" target ="_blank">2015 SOP</a>.  Surveys are conducted in hard-bottom habitat in water <30 m, following a stratified-random sampling site design (StRS). Random sites are generated across islands using reef zone, depth zone, pre-determined sectors, and locations of known hard-bottom habitat (typically from backscatter data), using the R project <a href = "https://github.com/krtanaka/ncrmp_common_map" target = "_blank">ncrmp_common_map</a>.
