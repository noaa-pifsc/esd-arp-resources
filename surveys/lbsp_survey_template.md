survey_type: Surveys along a water quality gradient
survey_description: LBSP is funded by various CRCP projects since 2012 and comprises a collection of benthic surveys to assess impacts of <a href ="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/pacific-islands/ecosystems/coral-health-and-threats-pacific-islands#pollution" target ="_blank">land-based sources of pollution</a> on coral reefs primarily in Tutuila, American Samoa in Vatia, Faga'alu, Aua, and Nu'uuli Bays, and also in Maui and O'ahu (in progress). Local partners identify priority watersheds where a water quality gradient is likely to exist, and we investigate the gradient as well as any impacts to the coral reef ecosystems.
