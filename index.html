excerpt: "Since 2000, we have collected data to support the protection and management of U.S. Pacific coral reefs. Based in Honolulu, Hawai‘i, we work within the Ecosystem Sciences Division (ESD) at NOAA’s Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). Our work is primarily funded by projects under the Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP), with a focus on the Pacific National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP)."
intro: 
  - excerpt: 'Following NOAA Fisheries'' dedication to stewardship of the nation''s ocean resources, we use rigorous scientific research and an ecosystem-based approach to provide critical data on coral reef <a href ="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/pacific-islands/ecosystems/coral-health-and-threats-pacific-islands">communities</a>, fish populations, ocean conditions, and chemistry. Our long-term, high-quality data supports scientists, resource managers, and the public, offering valuable tools like the <a href = "https://ncrmp.coralreef.noaa.gov/">NCRMP Data Viz Tool</a>.'
