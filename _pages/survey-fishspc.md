### Fish Surveys
<p>

Fish diversity and biomass of shallow-water coral reef ecosystems has been measured using Stationary-point-count (SPC) method by our program since 2013. These are surveys that serve as a 'snapshot' of the fish diversity and biomass at given sites across a region that after analysis provide a census survey of how fish communities are changing over time for a given region. </p>
<br>

### How to conduct Fish SPC surveys
Random sites are first generated following sector-strata allocations, following the two-stage stratified-random sampling (StRS) design. See Data sheets below.

### How to download and use our data
Data is collected and QC'd using a data entry app and analyzed using R scripts. Raw data is archived with NCEI.
For assistance and tools on how to adopt a similar strategy at your institution, contact the Data Services Team at nmfs.pic.credinfo@noaa.gov
