  title: "What do we survey"
  excerpt: We survey fish in coral reef habitat to see how fish communities may be changing.  For SPC surveys, Pacific reef fish are surveyed in hard-bottom habitat shallower than 30 m. Random sites are generated across islands using data on reef zone, depth bin, habitat, and pre-determined sectors based on differences such as reef structure and local human population density. We use a weighted average approach to analyze fish communities at several scales.

  title: How do we survey
  excerpt:  The stationary point count (SPC) method involves two divers counting fish at the same time in two side-by-side, 15-meter-wide circular areas that extend from the ocean floor to as far as they can see vertically.The survey has two parts, the first is Species Identification (5 minutes) when each diver records all the different types of fish they see within their area.  After the first 5 minutes, they start counting and measuring, when divers go through their list and count how many of each species they see, estimating their length in centimeters. They do this by scanning their area multiple times, focusing on one species group per scan.More details about our survey protocol can be found on the <a href = "https://ncrmp.coralreef.noaa.gov/">NCRMP Data Viz Tool</a> as well as under <a href = "/sops/">'Methods'</a>. In previous years, the Pacific RAMP and NCRMP have also conducted belt transects and towed-diver surveys to assess fish assemblages."

  title: What do we measure
  excerpt: Divers collect fish species, count and size data, which can then be used to calculate biomass, fish density, and occurrence per species. We also analyze the data by looking at individual fish species, across consumer groups (primary, secondary, planktivore, etc.), and all fishes combined.  We analyze this data using weighted averages at the sector, subjurisdiction, and jurisdictional scale.

### Survey Goals
The Pacific NCRMP monitors coral reefs across a vast area, covering about 40 islands and atolls spread over thousands of kilometers. The goal of the fish surveys is to provide periodic snapshots of coral reef communities at U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands. To achieve this, the survey is designed to collect data at the scale of entire islands and atolls. This makes NCRMP a “wide-but-thin” program—meaning it focuses on broad regional trends rather than detailed, site-specific studies. The goal is to provide big-picture insights into the health of shallow coral reef ecosystems (0–30 m deep) to support management and conservation efforts.

### Why do we survey
In accordance with the NCRMP goals and objectives, the reef-fish data are collected in a consistent, standardized manner across the U.S. and U.S.-affiliated territories in the Western and Central Pacific, spanning wide gradients in both natural drivers and human impact. The resulting datasets serve four main purposes: 
1. Fulfill NCRMP mandates to assess the status and trends of reef fish assemblages across coral reefs of the U.S. 
2. Provide data in support of coral reef fisheries stocks;
3. Support federal and jurisdictional management by providing a broad spatial context to status and trends apparent from spatially smaller-scale surveys conducted by those agencies
4. Generate a consistent and large-scale dataset as a resource for the scientific community. In synchrony with our other reef surveys, we can also investigate potential patterns with environmental or benthic changes

### Access Data
Under <a href = "/products/">'Products'</a> you can visualize and access our data using the NCRMP Visualization tool. You can go to <a href = "/sops/">'Methods'</a> to see access for specific datasets. For raw data, our data is organized in NCEI collections.  Browse datasets in the <a href = "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/28844" target = "_blank">NCRMP metadata catalog</a> for each distinct region; legacy datasets are described in the <a href = "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/21559" target ="_blank">Ecosystem Monitoring and Assessment subfolder</a>.
