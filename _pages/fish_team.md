  title: "What do we survey"
  excerpt: We survey fish in coral reef habitat to see how fish communities may be changing.  For SPC surveys, Pacific reef fish are surveyed in hard-bottom habitat shallower than 30 m. Random sites are generated across islands using data on reef zone, depth bin, habitat, and pre-determined sectors based on differences such as reef structure and local human population density. We use a weighted average approach to analyze fish communities at several scales.

  title: How do we survey
  excerpt: We follow the NCRMP <b>stationary-point-count (SPC)</b> protocol which is detailed on the <a href = "https://ncrmp.coralreef.noaa.gov/">NCRMP Data Viz Tool</a> as well as under <a href = "/sops/">'Methods'</a>. Diver pairs count fish simultaneously in adjacent visually estimated 15 m cylinders.  In the first 5 minutes they record the species they see in their respective cylinders, and after that period they begin counting and sizing (to the nearest cm) of each individual fish per species.

  title: What do we measure
  excerpt: Divers collect fish species, count and size data, which can then be used to calculate biomass, fish density, and occurrence per species. We also analyze the data by looking at individual fish species, across consumer groups (primary, secondary, planktivore, etc.), and all fishes combined.  We analyze this data using weighted averages at the sector, subjurisdiction, and jurisdictional scale.

  title: Why do we survey
  excerpt: To assist in informing management as well as using this data in synchrony with our other reef surveys to inspect whether there are any patterns with environmental changes.

### Why do we survey
The data collected serve four main purposes: 1. to fulfill NCRMP mandates to assess the status and trends of reef fish assemblages across coral reefs of the U.S.; 2. to provide data in support of coral reef fisheries stocks; 3. to support federal and jurisdictional management by providing a broad spatial context to status and trends apparent from spatially smaller-scale surveys conducted by those agencies; and 4. to generate a consistent and large-scale dataset as a resource for the scientific community. In synchrony with our other reef surveys, we can also investigate potential patterns with environmental or benthic changes.

### Access Data
Under <a href = "/products/">'Products'</a> you can visualize and access our data using the NCRMP Visualization tool. You can go to <a href = "/sops/">'Methods'</a> to see access for specific datasets. For raw data, our data is organized in NCEI collections.  Browse datasets in the <a href = "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/28844" target = "_blank">NCRMP metadata catalog</a> for each distinct region; legacy datasets are described in the <a href = "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/21559" target ="_blank">Ecosystem Monitoring and Assessment subfolder</a>.
