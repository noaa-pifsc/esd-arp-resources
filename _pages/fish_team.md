### Summary
<p>
Fish surveys are conducted in the Pacific Islands regions to monitor changes in biomass, species richness, and biodiversity over time. Primarily we conduct stationary-point-count(SPC) surveys. Historically we have also collected fish belt (BLT) and towed-diver surveys.</p>

### Why do we survey
This data informs policy makers and stakeholders the status of the biodiversity and biomass of reef fish species. In synchrony with our other reef surveys, we can also investigate potential patterns with enviornmental or benthic changes.

### Access Data
Under 'Products' you can visualize and access our data using the NCRMP Visualization tool. You can go to 'Methods' to see access for specific datasets. For raw data, our data is organized in NCEI collections.
