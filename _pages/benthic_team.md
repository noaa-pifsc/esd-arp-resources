  title: "What do we survey"
  excerpt: We collect benthic data of shallow coral reef ecosystems (up to 100ft). This means identifying, counting, and sizing different organisms of the benthos. We conduct coral demography surveys (hard coral composition of adults and juveniles), as well as benthic cover surveys (cover of algae, CCA, hard coral, and other taxa).

  title: "How do we survey"
  excerpt: "From 2013-2023 coral demographic data was collected by divers along a transect at multiple sites across islands across a region. Starting in 2024 we transitioned to extracting coral demographic data from structure-from-motion (SfM) imagery.  For benthic cover, we collect photoquadrat imagery along a transect at a given site, and annotate the images later using CoralNet. We collect photoquadrats at random sites which allow us to estimate benthic cover of an island or region.  Some sites are revisited (fixed sites) so we can compare changes in the benthos over time.  We access sites using a NOAA vessel, and occasionally also run shore-based surveys"

  title: "What do we measure"
  excerpt: "We measure benthic cover, which can be described as identification of the different organisms, or taxa, living on the benthos (seafloor). We also  measure coral demography by identifying, counting, and measuring juvenile and adult hard corals.  we also track the condition of adult hard corals (disease, bleaching, etc.)."

  title: "Why do we survey"
  excerpt: "By revisiting these regions since 2013 we can monitor and see how coral reef ecosystems are changing over time such as higher or lower coral cover, or coral recruitment or loss. We produce technical memoranda for policy makers that provide a summary of the status of coral reefs and inform management decisions. We can also integrate our benthic data with our fish and oceanographic data to investigate patterns in ecosystem shifts."

### Summary
<p>
The ESD collects data to monitor and understand benthic complexity in coral reef ecosystems with imaging surveys and belt transects. On top of the regular triennial NCRMP survey cycles, we also investigate bleaching events as they occur. Benthic cover is estimated with several different systems, and integrates machine-learning to aid in annotation of benthic images.  We have published a CoralNet Bleaching Classifier, ways to extract structural complexity from SfM imagery, and automated workflows to processs SfM imagery for annotation.</p>

### Access Data
Under 'Products' you can visualize and access our data using the NCRMP Visualization tool. You can go to 'Methods' to see access for specific datasets. For raw data, our data is organized in NCEI collections.
