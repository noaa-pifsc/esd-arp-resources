  title: "What do we survey"
  excerpt: "We collect benthic data of shallow coral reef ecosystems (up to 100ft). This means identifying, counting, and sizing different organisms of the benthos. We conduct coral demography surveys (hard coral composition of adults and juveniles), as well as benthic cover surveys (cover of algae, CCA, hard coral, and other taxa)."

  title: "How do we survey"
  excerpt: "For coral demography, divers collect in-situ measurements along a transect at a given site. Multiple random sites are surveyed around a given island in a region to approximate coral demography. Recently (2024) we transitioned to extracting coral demographic data from structure-from-motion (SfM) imagery.  For benthic cover, we collect photoquadrat imagery along a transect at a given site, and annotate the images using CoralNet. We collect photoquadrats at random sites which allow us to estimate benthic cover of an island or region.  Some sites are revisited (fixed sites) so we can compare changes in the benthos over time."

We identify, count, and measure juvenile and adult hard corals.  we also track the condition of adult hard corals (disease, bleaching, etc.)."

  title: "Why do we survey"
  excerpt: "By revisiting these regions since 2013 we can monitor and see how coral reef ecosystems are changing over time. We produce technical memoranda for policy makers that provide a summary of the status of coral reefs and suggest management directives."

### Summary
<p>
The ESD collects data to monitor and understand benthic complexity in coral reef ecosystems with imaging surveys and belt transects. On top of the regular triennial NCRMP survey cycles, we also investigate bleaching events as they occur. Benthic cover is estimated with several different systems, and integrates machine-learning to aid in annotation of benthic images.</p>
