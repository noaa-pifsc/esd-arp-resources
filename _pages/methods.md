### Summary
<p>
<img src= 'https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/48/42/64/360_F_248426448_NVKLywWqArG2ADUxDq6QprtIzsF82dMF.jpg' width="250" height=auto ALIGN="left" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10"/>
The ESD collects data to monitor and understand benthic complexity in coral reef ecosystems with imaging surveys and belt transects. On top of the regular triennial NCRMP survey cycles, they also investigate bleaching events as they occur. Benthic cover is estimated with several different systems, and integrates machine-learning to aid in annotation of benthic images.</p>

### How to download and use our data
 Due to the size of structure-from-motion (SfM) imagery, we have made our raw imagery as well as products available via Google Cloud Bucket. Raw imagery is also archived on NCEI OER Portal.
For assistance and tools on how to adopt a similar strategy at your institution, contact the Data Services Team at nmfs.pic.credinfo@noaa.gov
