  title: "How do we survey"
  excerpt: "We deploy stand-alone instruments on the reef for several years such as <b>STRs</b> (subsurface-temperature-recorders), <b>CAUs</b>  (calcium-accretion-units), and <b>BMUs</b> (bioerosion-monitoring-units). We also deploy an assortment of instruments called a <b>diel suite</b> for several days to weeks (includes PAR, DO, ADCP, pH, etc.). <b>Water samples and CTD surveys</b> are conducted off dive boats or NOAA research vessels at random, fixed, and offshore sites. The <b>carbonate budgets</b> methodology, which we adapted for Pacific coral reefs, estimates whether a reef is growing, eroding, or at a tipping point."

### Why do we conduct these surveys
By revisiting these sites in regions since 2013 we can monitor the impact of changing ocean conditions to coral reefs to inform management decisions. The methodologies we use are chosen to leverage the usability and reproducibility of our data such that it can be integrated with other datasets.

### GitHub Repositories
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hannahbarkley/reefbudgetR" target ="_blank">Carbonate Budgets Scripts & Calcification Rates Database</a></li>
</ul>

### Access Data
The NCRMP Visualization tool hosts water samples for <b>random sites</b>. Water chemistry (including for fixed sites) is archived with OCADS, and all other data is organized in NCEI collections and cataloged in our <a href = "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/28844" target = "_blank">NCRMP metadata catalog</a> for each distinct region.  Refer to <a href = "/sops/">'Methods'</a> for details on specific surveys.
