  title: "How do we survey"
  excerpt: "We deploy stand-alone instruments on the reef for several years such as <b>STRs</b> (subsurface-temperature-recorders), <b>CAUs</b>  (calcium-accretion-units), and <b>BMUs</b> (bioerosion-monitoring-units). We also deploy an assortment of instruments called a <b>diel suite</b> for a week (includes PAR, DO, ADCP, pH, etc.). <b>Water samples and CTD surveys</b> are conducted off dive boats or NOAA research vessels at random, fixed, and offshore sites. The <b>carbonate budgets</b> methodology, which we adapted for Pacific coral reefs, estimates whether a reef is growing, shrinking, or at a tipping point."

### Why do we conduct these surveys
By revisiting these sites in regions since 2013 we can monitor reefs and the impact of climate change to inform management decisions. The methodogies we use are chosen to leverage the usability and reproducibiity of our data such that it can be integrated with other datasets.

### GitHub Repositories
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hannahbarkley/reefbudgetR" target ="_blank">Carbonate Budgets Scripts & Calcification Rates Database</a></li>
</ul>

### Access Data
The NCRMP Visualization tool hosts water samples for random sites. Water chemistry is archived with OCADS, and all other data is organized in NCEI collections and catalogged in our <a href = "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/28844" target = "_blank">NCRMP metadata catalog</a> for each distinct region.
