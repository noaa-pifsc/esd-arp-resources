  title: "How do we survey"
  excerpt: "We deploy stand-alone instruments on the reef for several years such as STRs, CAUs, and BMUs. We also deploy an assortment of instruments like diel suite for a week. Water samples and CTD surveys are conducted dive boats or NOAA research vessels."

### Summary
<p>
The Ocean and Climate Change Team investigates the impacts of climate change on coral reefs of the US Pacific Islands to inform resilience based management of these important ecosystems. While working in synchrony with other teams investigating reef ecology, the OCC Team focuses on studying carbonate chemistry, carbonate budgets and ocean warming.</p>
