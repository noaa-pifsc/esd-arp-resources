  title: "How do we survey"
  excerpt: "We deploy stand-alone instruments on the reef for several years such as <b>STRs, CAUs, and BMUs</b>. We also deploy an assortment of instruments like <b>diel suite</b> for a week. <b>Water samples and CTD surveys</b> are conducted off dive boats or NOAA research vessels. <b>Carbonate budgets</b> methodology was also adapted for Pacific coral reefs."

### Why do we conduct these surveys
By revisiting these sites in regions since 2013 we can monitor reefs and the impact of climate change to inform management decisions. The methodogies we use are chosen to leverage the usability and reproducibiity of our data such that it can be integrated with other datasets.

### GitHub Repositories
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hannahbarkley/reefbudgetR" target ="_blank">Carbonate Budgets Scripts & Calcification Rates Database</a></li>
</ul>

### Access Data
The NCRMP Visualization tool hosts water samples for random sites. Water chemistry is archived with OCADS, and other data is organized in NCEI collections.
